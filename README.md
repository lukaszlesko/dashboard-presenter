# Dashboard presenter

Simple extension to Chrome that's allow you to:

1. Set refresh interval (in miliseconds),
2. Set desired Chrome tab in which presentation will happen (by index, so pass 1 to see your below URLs in 2nd tab opened in Chrome),
3. Pass list of URLs you want to see in above that, one after another after specified interval.

Put it to fullscreen and you can see multiple dashboards one after
another, Yay!
